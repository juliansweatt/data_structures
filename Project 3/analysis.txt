Stack<T>::clear() Implementation:

template<typename T>
void Stack<T>::clear()
{
  data.clear(); // Where data is a std::vector<T>
}

Complexity:  O(n) [linear]
Explanation: The Stack class is built using the stl::vector class.
             So, Stack<T>::clear() calls the stl::vector version of clear()
             which functions by iterating through the array, destroying
             each element. Because this process is dependent on the length
             of the array/vector, it's complexity is linear (O(n)).
             Therefore, Stack<T>::clear() shares the same complexity.
Argument:    Stack class was built upon slt:vector instead of as a linked list
             because the array/vector can be accessed from the begining or from an
             known element.
