# Binary Tree Implenetation
**Course:** COP4530  
**Instructor:** Duan  
**Project:** Project 4

# Description
Converts postfix expressions into infix expressions using a binary expression tree implementation. 

This program forms a Binary Search Tree in post-fix order from a string where the string is also in post-fix notation. Tree can be used to print the function in post-fix or in-fix notations.
